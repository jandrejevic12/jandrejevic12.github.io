      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;at-a-glance&#34;&gt;At a Glance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My teaching experience during graduate studies at Harvard University has included assisting undergraduate and graduate level courses, developing a student-led mini-course, as well as formal training in effective pedagogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I served as Teaching Fellow for the following courses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applied Physics 50A - Physics as a Foundation for Science and Engineering I&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applied Physics 50B - Physics as a Foundation for Science and Engineering II&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineering Sciences 301 - SEAS Teaching Practicum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applied Math 205 - Advanced Scientific Computing: Numerical Methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My teaching philosophy statement is &lt;a href=&#34;../../uploads/teaching_statement.pdf&#34;&gt;available here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;graduate-teaching-experience&#34;&gt;Graduate Teaching Experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a second-year graduate student, I had the opportunity to work with Prof. Eric Mazur and teach undergraduate physics in a nontraditional setting that emphasizes peer instruction and active learning. As a Teaching Fellow, my role included co-facilitating a weekly lab section, holding office hours and grading homework, as well as mentoring student groups on two long-term projects each semester. Teaching in a nontraditional setting was pivotal to my own development as an educator and helped me formulate the core teaching values I hope to exemplify in my academic career, which can be found in my &lt;a href=&#34;../../uploads/teaching_statement.pdf&#34;&gt;teaching statement&lt;/a&gt;. In 2018 and 2019, I was awarded the White Teaching Prize for excellence in teaching undergraduate physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fall semesters of 2020 and 2021, I served as a Teaching Fellow for Advanced Scientific Computing: Numerical Methods, a graduate-level course taught by Prof. Chris Rycroft that introduces the fundamentals of scientific computing, from data-fitting and optimization to numerical calculus and solutions to systems of differential equations. In addition to holding office hours and grading problem sets, I prepared and led three lessons as part of a groupwork component of the course, and designed accompanying exercises that were completed in groups. Each semester, I closely mentored several student groups on their final projects, providing guidance on their initial proposal, and holding check-ins and advice throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching at Harvard has cultivated my passion for the science of teaching and effective classroom practices as well. As a fourth-year student, I trained as a Pedagogy Fellow through Harvard’s Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning. During this year-long position, I delved into active research topics in science education, attending weekly lessons, as well as participating in and facilitating a pedagogy journal club in the engineering department. I also mentored new graduate Teaching Fellows in their roles by holding microteaching practice sessions, observing lectures or office hours, and holding one-on-one consultations. Finally, I served as Teaching Fellow for the SEAS Teaching Practicum taught by John Girash, a course emphasizing hands-on teaching practice including lesson planning, developing problem sets, giving feedback, and communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January of 2020, I helped to design and co-facilitate a winter workshop on the topic of generative art at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology along with three fellow PhD students: Nina Andrejevic, George Varnavides, and Amina Matt. The course emphasized mathematical and natural examples of pattern formation such as fractals, cellular automata, swarming and self-organization, and emergent structure in reaction-diffusion processes. Due to high interest the following year, we resumed in virtual format in 2021, and continued in 2022, thoroughly reworking the course material to adapt it to this new setting. We focused on tailoring our code examples to be highly interactive and developed open-ended design challenges for the students to build upon class examples and showcase their creativity. Developing and helping lead this course has been an invaluable opportunity to synthesize the training and practice I&amp;rsquo;ve received.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Statistical properties of crumpled sheets</title>
      <link>https://jandrejevic12.github.io/project/fragmentation_model/</link>

      <guid>https://jandrejevic12.github.io/project/fragmentation_model/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A key aspect of my research has been to better understand the statistical properties of crumpled sheets, as well as the mechanisms that can produce these statistics. As a familiar example, consider the process of crumpling a sheet of paper into a ball. Upon opening the sheet, we observe a complex network of creases where stresses sharply focused during compaction, introducing permanent, plastic deformation. We might ask how the amount of damage introduced varies with the strength of compaction, or how it is distributed spatially across the sheet.&lt;/p&gt;









  





&lt;video autoplay loop  &gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;https://jandrejevic12.github.io/project/fragmentation_model/unfold.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crumpling is a ubiquitous phenomenon that can be observed on many different length scales, from the scale of graphene membranes up to the deformation of the earth’s crust. And while crumpling might seem an unwelcome deformation at first glance, the properties of crumpled structures can offer a number of practical advantages due to their porosity, compression-resistance, shapeability, and lightweight nature. For instance, one exciting application of crumpling is in the context of batteries and supercapacitors: Crumpled graphene electrodes are shown to have higher electrochemical surface area and resistance to aggregation owing to the high porosity and rigidity of the crumpled state&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a scientific perspective, crumpling has garnered wide interest due to surprisingly predictable behavior that can be observed amidst this very disordered process. Let&amp;rsquo;s consider the simple crumpled ball experiment once again. If we crumple the same unfolded sheet a second time, new creases will develop; however, we expect the sheet to accumulate less additional damage, as it can exploit some of its existing creases during crumpling. A natural question we might ask is whether there is a rule for how such damage accumulates under repeated loading. Building on this idea, the experimental research group of Prof. Shmuel Rubinstein conducted studies of systematic crumpling by compressing a rolled sheet of Mylar with a cylindrical piston to a fixed compaction ratio, unfolding the sheet, and repeating the process. They discovered that when the total crease length accumulated is viewed as a function of crumpling iterations, the growth follows a simple logarithm&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\ell(n,\tilde{\Delta}) = c_1\left(1-\tilde{\Delta}\right)\log\left(1+c_2\frac{n}{\tilde{\Delta}}\right).$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the equation above, $\ell$ denotes total crease length, $n$ the number of crumpling iterations, and $\tilde{\Delta}$ the compaction ratio, which is the ratio of final to initial height of the piston. $c_1$ and $c_2$ are global fitting parameters. Surprisingly, this trend was robust to varying compaction ratio and initial preparations of the sheet, including pre-folding or hand-crumpling the sheet before repeated compaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logarithmic scaling was a remarkable reduction of complexity in characterizing crumpling. However, a physical justification for this mathematical model was missing: Can we explain why a logarithmic relationship, in particular, arises from this process? This question motivated our follow-up work to try and explain the origin of logarithmic growth on physical grounds&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We began by recognizing that as a sheet accumulates more creases over time, its surface area remains constant. Thus, rather than observing a quantity that continues to grow over time - the total crease length - we could instead look at a complementary quantity that remains invariant - the sum of individual facet areas. We found it valuable to perform the facet segmentations by hand, to ensure even the smallest facets were identified, and imaging artifacts such as faint or disconnected creases could be corrected. The facet segmentations then allowed us to observe the facet size distribution of each sheet, as well as its evolution over a series of crumples.&lt;/p&gt;









  





&lt;video autoplay loop  &gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;https://jandrejevic12.github.io/project/fragmentation_model/segmentation.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed that these characteristic size distributions could be accurately explained by fragmentation theory, which has a rich history in modeling natural breakup phenomena such as the crushing of rock or fragmentation of volcanic debris. Fragmentation processes can be represented by an integro-differential equation that captures the evolution of the fragment size distribution over time as follows&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\frac{\partial{c(x,t)}}{\partial{t}}=-r(x)c(x,t) + \int_x^{\infty}r(y)c(y,t)f(x|y)dy.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the equation above, $c(x,t)$ represents the number or concentration of fragments with size $x$ at time $t$, and $r(x)$ and $f(x|y)$ are the overall breakup rate and conditional breakup probability, respectively. With appropriate choices of $r(x)$ and $f(x|y)$ inferred from experimental data, the above equation can be solved exactly, with $c(x,t)$ in agreement with the observed facet size distributions. Building on the fragmentation theory framework, we likewise introduced a model for how the accumulation of damage slows down over repeated crumpling, as the average facet size becomes smaller. This allowed us to explain the logarithmic scaling seen in experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of fragmentation theory to understand crumpling is compelling, as it offers a new perspective on a well-studied system while drawing connections to other disordered processes. Future work could explore the extent to which fragmentation theory can more broadly model damage and failure in other systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of my current research, I have been developing a large-scale simulation of thin, elastoplastic sheets to aid our study and analysis of crumpling dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A popular model for elastic materials is a mass-spring system: a collection of discrete nodes that interact with their neighbors via linear springs. This simple framework can accurately reproduce continuum elastic properties of the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our work, we build on the widely-used elastic membrane model of Seung and Nelson&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and extend it to simulate self-avoiding, elastoplastic sheets. A key consideration in our implementation is the numerical procedure used to integrate the equations of motion for the sheet. We recognize that a sheet undergoing crumpling exhibits deformations on two different timescales: a slower timescale for wide-range smooth deformation, and a faster timescale for rapid buckling and local changes in velocity. This motivates two different formulations of the equations of motion: a quasistatic formulation in which acceleration is approximated as zero, and a dynamic formulation that retains acceleration as non-negligible. The quasistatic formulation may be efficiently integrated using an implicit scheme, while the dynamic formulation is handled explicitly. The complete model is implemented in C++ and multithreaded using OpenMP, and a paper for this work is currently in preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video above demonstrates one example simulation of a thin sheet radially confined into a ball. The sheet is modeled by 46767 nodes and 92716 triangles distributed randomly in a square domain. The sheet is compressed by a radial potential that mimics a spherical shell with decreasing radius. Short-range repulsive forces enforce the sheet’s self-avoidance, and plastic damage accumulates as regions of the sheet develop a large enough local curvature. Particularly interesting is the observation of individual snap-throughs of flat surfaces as the sheet locks in creases. The cross-sectional view midway through the video also reveals a high degree of layering of the sheet. After compressing for a time, the radius of the enclosing shell begins to increase, allowing the crumpled sheet to relax. At the end, the relaxed state of the sheet displays permanent plastic damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It&amp;rsquo;s a good platform for anyone looking to take control of their data and online identity whilst having the convenience to start off with a &lt;strong&gt;no-code solution (write in Markdown and customize with YAML parameters)&lt;/strong&gt; and having &lt;strong&gt;flexibility to later add even deeper personalization with HTML and CSS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can work with all your favourite tools and apps with hundreds of plugins and integrations to speed up your workflows, interact with your readers, and much more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Together with Nina Andrejevic, George Varnavides, and Amina Matt, I helped to design and co-facilitate a winter workshop on generative art at MIT in January of 2020. The course emphasizes mathematical and natural examples of pattern formation such as fractals, cellular automata, swarming and self-organization, and emergent structure in reaction-diffusion processes. The content of the course includes both relevant theory behind these examples, as well as effective strategies for implementation in code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Material from the latest installment (2022) can be found on the course &lt;a href=&#34;https://gvarnavides.com/generative-art-workshop-website&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gvarnavi/generative-art-iap&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Github repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Principal component analysis with van Gogh</title>
      <link>https://jandrejevic12.github.io/project/pca_van_gogh/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project uses a collection of van Gogh&amp;rsquo;s paintings to shed light on a versatile tool in data science: principal component analysis. A hallmark of van Gogh&amp;rsquo;s Impressionist style was its rendition of only the essential features of his subjects, favoring simpler representations accomplished with broad brush strokes and bold color palettes. In turn, principal component analysis can be thought of as a view through van Gogh&amp;rsquo;s eyes: By reducing a collection of data only to those essential features which capture the greatest variability across the dataset, it provides a simpler representation of high-dimensional data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please check out the Github repository for a detailed description of the project! In 2019, it was awarded first place in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/view/harvard-data-science-animation/home&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Harvard Data Science Animation Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
